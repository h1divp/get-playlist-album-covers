# Get Playlist Album Covers
Gets all album covers from a Spotify playlist using python. Made to make a tierlist.

For this script [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/master/) is needed:
`pip install spotipy`
  
In terminal (use 'set' on Windows):
`export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=""`
`export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=""`
`export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=""`

`SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` can be `"http://localhost:8080"`
You will need to make an app using [Spotify's web API](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) in order to get the other things.
